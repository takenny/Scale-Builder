//Scale builder
//ignore existing project (it doesnt work)

Requirements:
---------------------------------
- Allow user to select a scale and generate the scale
	- the scale will be different depening on the type (minor, major, phrygian, etc),
	- the scale generator will correctly display accidentals
- other options:
	- display the diatonic triads in that key 

-Possible future features:
  - display extended triads


Possible Classes:
-----------------------------------
Note class:
- holds note data ( value and accidental)
	- could also be a struct (guess were doing c++...lol)
	- need method to calculate intervals (space betweeen notes)
		- could be done using by overloading the - operator
			or just making a function to calculate interval.

Scale class:
- generetes scale and holds scale data
- needs some sort of array to hold all the seven notes in the scale

Scale pattern generator:
- generates the scale pattern
	- Major is W W H W W W H and the other modes are just shifted over

Triad generator class:
- just generates the traids (could also be a function in scale?) 

Menu class:
- make a nice-ish cli...

(we could also implent an abstract class and sub classes for each scale or 
use the decorator pattern, my original idea seems the easiest to implement);
